I am very fond of studying foreign languages because someday I would like to travel to different places around the world. I am verypassionate about my dream 
and right now I'm really working hard for it to come true. I am currently studying Nihongo at the moment but after that I would also like to try other languages as well
preferably european languages.

I also love makeup but to be honest my favorite part about makeup is collecting them. I don't know why but I just feel very happy to 
know that my drawers are full of it and that I have a lot of toys to play with. This is also where most of my money disappears to, I often
get yelled at by my mom because I keep on buying makeup even though I have a lot of it already. She also doesn't like the fact that I tend
to give them away because I can't use them up and most of the time it goes bad before I get to finish using them up and I end throwing
them in the trash can :'(

I have a major sweet tooth. I love to bake and to cook as well but if I was asked to choose between the two then I would pick baking.
I used to bake a lot but when our oven was having problems with keeping the temperature to how you set it up, I haven't baked anything 
since because you need to be really precise when it comes to baking, the measurements and the temperature set up is really strict because
you won't end up with a great result if you are not precise with it.
